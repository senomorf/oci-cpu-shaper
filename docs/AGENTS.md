# AGENTS

## Scope: `docs/`
- Mirror current behavior: revise affected docs and `docs/CHANGELOG.md` per §12 whenever features/configs shift.
- Capture QA rules: mention ≥85% coverage (`make coverage`) and the required test updates when you describe workflows.
- Keep headings tight and aligned with plan section numbers (e.g., §§4–7) for quick cross-reference.
- Preserve OCI/kernel citations; add new references using Markdown reference links.
