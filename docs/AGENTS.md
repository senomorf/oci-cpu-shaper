# AGENTS

## Scope: `docs/`
- Keep documentation in sync with shipped behavior; update the files listed in §12 when related features change.
- Use concise headings mirroring the plan’s numbering (e.g., §§4–7) so readers can cross-reference easily.
- Include OCI and kernel citations as in the plan; prefer Markdown links with reference-style footnotes when adding new sources.
